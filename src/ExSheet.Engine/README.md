# ExSheet.Engine

The formula engine of ExSheet, with no UI and no dependency. It holds a **Sheet** — Excel's
extent, 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns, held sparsely — and computes the **Value** of every
cell from its **Entry**:

- Formulas in Excel's syntax, written the same way in every culture (`,` between arguments, `.`
  as the decimal separator, English function names)
- a declared set of functions, each giving Excel's result; a function outside the set is `#NAME?`,
  never an approximation
- recalculation of only what a change reaches, publishing Values only from a completed
  recalculation; a circular reference is `#CIRC!` in every cell of the cycle and every cell that
  depends on it

The **Sheet Document** is the Sheet's serialisable form. It holds Entries and never Values, so
anyone who wants a saved Sheet's numbers runs this engine — on a server as in the browser, with
the same result.

> **This is a prerelease (`0.x`).** ExSheet is built alongside ExGrid and is not part of its
> release. The API may change between prereleases.

## Requirements

- **.NET 10 or newer.** The package targets `net10.0` and has no dependencies.

## Install

```sh
dotnet add package ExSheet.Engine --prerelease
```

## Computing a Sheet

```csharp
using System.Globalization;
using ExSheet.Engine;

var sheet = new Sheet(CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US"));
sheet.Enter(CellAddress.Parse("A1"), "2");
sheet.Enter(CellAddress.Parse("B1"), "3");
var change = sheet.Enter(CellAddress.Parse("C1"), "=A1+B1");

sheet.GetValue(CellAddress.Parse("C1"));   // 5
change.ValueChanges;                        // C1
```

`Enter` reads text as a user typed it: text beginning with `=` is a Formula, and anything else is
a constant read under the Sheet's culture and recorded already parsed.

## Functions

`DeclaredFunction.All` lists the declared set, with each function's arguments as Excel documents
them:

| Function | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MIN`, `MAX` | `number1, [number2], ...` |
| `COUNT`, `COUNTA` | `value1, [value2], ...` |
| `IF` | `logical_test, value_if_true, [value_if_false]` |
| `ROUND` | `number, num_digits` |
| `IFERROR` | `value, value_if_error` |
| `ISERROR` | `value` |
| `XLOOKUP` | `lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode]` |

Where the engine cannot give Excel's answer, it gives an Error Value and never a different
answer:

- **No spilled arrays.** A Formula whose result would be a multi-cell range, or an operator applied
  to one, is `#VALUE!`; so is an `XLOOKUP` whose return array is more than one cell across.
  `IFERROR` and `ISERROR` do not turn that refusal into a fallback.
- **`XLOOKUP`'s binary search** (`search_mode` 2 and −2) is `#VALUE!`.
- **`#CIRC!`** is shown by every cell of a circular reference and every Formula that reads one,
  where Excel shows 0. `IFERROR` does not catch it.
- **`#GETTING_DATA`**, a Linked Table's data on its way, is not an error to `IFERROR` and
  `ISERROR`, where Excel's are: a fallback never stands in for data that has not arrived.

The decisions behind the engine are ADR-0046 to ADR-0049 in
[`docs/adr/`](https://github.com/AkiraMisawa/ex-grid/tree/main/docs/adr), and the terms — Sheet,
Entry, Value, Formula, Reference, Error Value, Sheet Document — are defined in
[`CONTEXT.md`](https://github.com/AkiraMisawa/ex-grid/blob/main/CONTEXT.md).
