# ExSheet.Engine

The formula engine of ExSheet, with no UI and no dependency. It holds a **Sheet** — Excel's
extent, 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns, held sparsely — and computes the **Value** of every
cell from its **Entry**:

- Formulas in Excel's syntax, written the same way in every culture (`,` between arguments, `.`
  as the decimal separator, English function names)
- a declared set of functions, each giving Excel's result; a function outside the set is `#NAME?`,
  never an approximation
- recalculation of only what a change reaches, publishing Values only from a completed
  recalculation; a circular reference is `#CIRC!` in every cell of the cycle and every cell that
  depends on it

The **Sheet Document** is the Sheet's serialisable form. It holds Entries and never Values, so
anyone who wants a saved Sheet's numbers runs this engine — on a server as in the browser, with
the same result.

> **This is a prerelease (`0.x`).** ExSheet is built alongside ExGrid and is not part of its
> release. The API may change between prereleases.

## Requirements

- **.NET 10 or newer.** The package targets `net10.0` and has no dependencies.

## Install

```sh
dotnet add package ExSheet.Engine --prerelease
```

## Computing a Sheet

```csharp
using System.Globalization;
using ExSheet.Engine;

var sheet = new Sheet(CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US"));
sheet.Enter(CellAddress.Parse("A1"), "2");
sheet.Enter(CellAddress.Parse("B1"), "3");
var change = sheet.Enter(CellAddress.Parse("C1"), "=A1+B1");

sheet.GetValue(CellAddress.Parse("C1"));   // 5
change.ValueChanges;                        // C1
```

`Enter` reads text as a user typed it: text beginning with `=` is a Formula, and anything else is
a constant read under the Sheet's culture and recorded already parsed.

## Functions

`DeclaredFunction.All` lists the declared set, with each function's arguments as Excel documents
them:

| Function | Arguments |
|---|---|
| `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MIN`, `MAX` | `number1, [number2], ...` |
| `COUNT`, `COUNTA` | `value1, [value2], ...` |
| `IF` | `logical_test, value_if_true, [value_if_false]` |
| `ROUND` | `number, num_digits` |
| `IFERROR` | `value, value_if_error` |
| `ISERROR` | `value` |
| `XLOOKUP` | `lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode]` |

Where the engine cannot give Excel's answer, it gives an Error Value and never a different
answer:

- **No spilled arrays.** A Formula whose result would be a multi-cell range, or an operator applied
  to one, is `#VALUE!`; so is an `XLOOKUP` whose return array is more than one cell across.
  `IFERROR` and `ISERROR` do not turn that refusal into a fallback.
- **`XLOOKUP`'s binary search** (`search_mode` 2 and −2) is `#VALUE!`.
- **`#CIRC!`** is shown by every cell of a circular reference and every Formula that reads one,
  where Excel shows 0. `IFERROR` does not catch it.
- **`#GETTING_DATA`**, a Linked Table's data on its way, is not an error to `IFERROR` and
  `ISERROR`, where Excel's are: a fallback never stands in for data that has not arrived.

## Operations, and undoing them

Every user operation is a `SheetEdit`, and `Sheet.Do` returns the one `SheetStep` that undoes and
redoes it, each with one recalculation. The stack of steps is the caller's.

```csharp
var step = sheet.Do(SheetEdit.InsertRows(row: 2));   // References are rewritten to keep naming the same cells
step.Undo();                                         // Entries, formats and References exactly as they were
```

- **Insertion and deletion** of rows and columns rewrite every Reference, relative and absolute
  alike; a range grows or shrinks as Excel's does, and a Reference whose cells are all deleted is
  written `#REF!` in the stored Formula. An insertion that would push an Entry, or the cells a
  Reference names, off the Sheet's edge is refused (`SheetRefusedException`).
- **Copy and paste.** `Sheet.Copy(range)` gives the Entries (`SheetBlock`) for a paste inside
  the Sheet, where relative References shift by the distance pasted, and the Values for anywhere
  else: `Text` as the cells show them, `Html` unformatted. `SheetEdit.PasteText` reads each
  pasted field as if typed under the Sheet's culture. A copy that reaches a `#GETTING_DATA`
  Value is refused.
- **Fill.** `SheetEdit.Fill(source, target, direction)` fills as Excel does for copies (with
  References shifted), a linear trend from two or more numbers, and a single date by day, and
  refuses every other pattern — `Item 1`, day and month names, several dates — rather than fill
  it with copies.
- `Sheet.Check(edit)` says whether an edit would be refused, without doing it.

## Linked Tables

Data the application holds reaches Formulas as a Linked Table, pushed whole and read by
structured reference and by key:

```csharp
sheet.DeclareLinkedTable("Positions", ["Id", "PV"]);
sheet.Enter(CellAddress.Parse("A1"), "=XLOOKUP(\"R-4471\", Positions[Id], Positions[PV])");
// A1 is #GETTING_DATA until the first snapshot arrives.
sheet.PushLinkedTable("Positions", [[Value.FromText("R-4471"), Value.FromNumber(250.5)]]);
```

A snapshot replaces the last in one step and recalculates only the Formulas that read the table.
A table's rows are never recorded in the Sheet Document.

## Formula entry

`FormulaEntry` answers, over a Formula's unfinished text and its caret, what an editor needs:
completion candidates (`Sheet.Complete` adds the Sheet's Linked Tables to the functions), the
argument hint, whether a Reference can be written at the caret (Point mode), and the Reference
text for a range.
