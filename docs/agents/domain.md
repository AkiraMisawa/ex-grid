# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── src/
    ├── ordering/
    │   ├── CONTEXT.md
    │   └── docs/adr/                  ← context-specific decisions
    └── billing/
        ├── CONTEXT.md
        └── docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_

## This repo's rules take precedence

`AGENTS.md` (which `CLAUDE.md` links to) governs where it and these skills differ:

- **The ADRs and `docs/definition-of-done.md` are authoritative.** A spec, a test, or a
  conversation that disagrees with them is the defect.
- **ADRs here are full documents, not one paragraph.** Follow the shape of the existing ones in
  `docs/adr/` rather than the minimal template in the `domain-modeling` skill. When a decision
  changes, rewrite the ADR and leave what changed and why in its text.
- **Decisions are serial.** A background agent never writes an ADR, `CONTEXT.md` or
  `docs/definition-of-done.md`; it returns the proposal to the orchestrator, who puts it to the
  user.
- **Test names carry the ADR number** they pin (see "Tests" in `AGENTS.md`).
