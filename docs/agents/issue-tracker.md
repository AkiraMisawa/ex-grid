# Issue tracker: docs/specs/

Specs and tickets for this repo live as markdown files under `docs/specs/`, versioned with the
ADRs and `docs/definition-of-done.md` they implement. Like everything committed here, they are
written in English.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `docs/specs/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `docs/specs/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation tickets are one file per ticket at
  `docs/specs/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, never a single combined
  tickets file
- Triage state is a `Status:` line near the top of each file. The roles are `needs-triage`,
  `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments`
  heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `docs/specs/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed). "Apply
the `<role>` label" means write `Status: <role>` near the top of that file.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the ticket number
directly.

## A spec is not a decision record

A spec synthesises decisions that already exist; it does not make new ones. Where writing it
exposes a decision the ADRs do not yet contain, stop and record the ADR first (see `domain.md`),
then cite it from the spec. A spec that disagrees with an ADR or with
`docs/definition-of-done.md` is wrong, not the ADR.
